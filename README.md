## Arctic sea ice prediction scripts

Python scripts used to produce seasonal forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent.

Petty, A. A., D. Schroder, J. C. Stroeve, T. Markus, J. Miller, N. T. Kurtz, D. L. Feltham, D. Flocco (2017), Skillful spring forecasts of September Arctic sea-ice extent using passive microwave sea ice observations, J. Geophys. Res. Earthâ€™s Future

Individual descriptions should be included at the top of each script.

If you want to run the raw procesing scripts (e.g. to generate the gridded forecast datasets), the following datasets are needed:

Sea ice concentration data (final): http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051 
Sea ice concentration data (near real-time): https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081
Melt onset data: http://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=54

Note that the melt pond data were provided by CPOM-Reading, with the processed forecast data included in this repo.

Note also that Python 2.7 was used for all processing. I have not tested these scripts in Python 3.
