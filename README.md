# Arctic sea ice forecasting
by Alek Petty

Python scripts used to produce seasonal forecasts of Arctic (and Alaskan) sea ice extent.

## Scripts

Individual descriptions should be included at the top of each script. Not all processing/plotting scripts have been included yet.

Python 2.7 was used for all processing. I have not tested these scripts in Python 3.

I use Conda to intall/manage the various Python packages. Check out the file 'packages.txt' for a list of the Python package versions I used to run these Scripts. I should probably do this in a conda environment and output that information at some point.

Information about installing Conda/Python, and a brief introduction to using Python can be found on my NASA Cryospheric Sciences meetup repo: https://github.com/akpetty/cryoscripts.

## Data

The gridded forecast datasets were generated from the following, pubclically available datasets:

Sea ice concentration data (final): http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051 
Sea ice concentration data (near real-time): https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081
Melt onset data: http://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/csb/index.php?section=54
(note that the melt onset data are not made avilable each year near real-time, so contact me if required).

Simulated melt pond data were provided by CPOM-Reading, with the detrended forecast data included in this repo.

Contact me if you any any questions!
